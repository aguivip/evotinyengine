This engine is used by demo group evoflash. (http://www.evoflash.fi/)<br />

Demos made with this engine:<br />
  * Spiral Out http://www.simppa.fi/asm10/spiralout/<br />
  * Blockparty 2010 invtro http://www.simppa.fi/demo/blockparty_invtro/<br />
  * Severity of Grey http://www.simppa.fi/asm09/<br />

Qualities:
  * Accurate beat synchronisation.
  * Provides all kind of useful parameters to modifiers.
  * Based on linked lists and object pooling, therefor fast.
  * Stack of post-process effects.
  * Easy memory handling.
  * Solutions based on 10 years of experience in flash demo coding. Which counts absolutely nothing.
  * Easy to extend and exploit.
  * It's very good.
  * There are no known bugs.
  * There are no bugs.
  * If there is a bug (which there isn't) it'll be fixed before next Assembly.
  * It's very easy to use after you've learned it.
  * Did you know that it's impossible for a normal person to lick own elbow.
  * This engine is under constant development.
  * ahh and it works only with flash player 10 or newer.
  * Apple mobiles such as iPad cannot run demos made with this. I take full responsibility for that.
  * Coding demos with this engine is delightful.

If you do cool post-process modifiers please share!
